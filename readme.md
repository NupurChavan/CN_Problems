3.
Build a simple client-server system, where you use the client to chat with a server. The protocol between the client and server is as follows.

    The server is first started on a known port.
    The client program is started (server IP and port are provided on the command line).
    The client connects to the server and then asks the user for input. The user types his message on the terminal.
    The user's input is sent to the server via the connected socket.
    The server reads the user's input from the client socket. 
    The client then reads the reply from the server.
    The server must reply to the client.
    The client asks the user for the next message to send to the server.

## üåü To Contribute

1. 

A chat room application in which each user first enters by giving his/her name and start sharing textual messages with all other users available in the chat room.

The user can see all the messages with the sender names (given at the start of entering into the chat room) with a current receiving time of the message.

When anybody leaves the chat room a message to all current chat applicants available in the chat room is able to see that the corresponding user left.

Every message from the user contains its receiving time as well.

Here the application is to be implemented like a multithreaded two-way communication program with necessary synchronization among the threads
